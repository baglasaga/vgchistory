# Pokemon VGC Stats & Match History Tracker

## Background

- **What will the application do?**

This application will allow users to keep track of their competitive Pokemon matches,
and provides information such as which games they've won or lost, which Pokemon were
brought on each team, Pokemon usage rates, the user's overall win-rate and ranking, 
and their overall win-rate with or against individual Pokemon.

- **Who will use it?**

This tool will be used by competitive Pokemon players wanting to track their own growth 
and improve at the game. Since they are able to see exactly which Pokemon they struggle 
the most against, and what Pokemon they win the most with, they will be able to know 
where their strengths and weaknesses lie. 

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project is of interest to me because I have recently been getting into the *VGC*
format of competitive Pokemon, and have not been able to find a match history tracking 
tool that would usually exist for other competitive games.

## Phase 4: Task 3
Looking at the UML class diagram for my project, the first piece of refactoring I would perform would be to 
apply the Singleton design pattern to MatchHistory, as I noticed it being used as a field for a majority of the 
classes in my ui package. This works very well, since it is just the same single instance of the Match History that 
is being passed around and used as a field between classes, so doing this would greatly reduce the number of times 
MatchHistory is used as a field. Additionally, the singleton design pattern could be applied to both the PokemonFinder
and PokemonDisplayer classes, as it would prevent extra unnecessary instantiations of them. These classes are really
only used to call their methods as helper methods of other methods, so there only needs to be one instantiation of them 
at a time to accomplish this. 

Along with this, the methods involving filtering the Pokemon in MatchHistory have extremely identical pieces of code 
(returnHighestWinRate, returnLowestWinRate), only differing in which operator is used (> or <), so I would fix this by 
making one combined method that took in a new parameter that decided which operator would be used. This same problem exists 
for the methods getHighestWinRates and getLowestWinRates, and would be solved in the same way.
