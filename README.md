# Pokemon VGC Stats & Match History Tracker

## Background

- **What will the application do?**

This application will allow users to keep track of their competitive Pokemon matches,
and provides information such as which games they've won or lost, which Pokemon were
brought on each team, Pokemon usage rates, the user's overall win-rate and ranking, 
their overall win-rate with or against individual Pokemon, and the win-rates of 
individual Pokemon against each other. 

- **Who will use it?**

This tool will be used by competitive Pokemon players wanting to track their own growth 
and improve at the game. Since they are able to see exactly which Pokemon they struggle 
the most against, and what Pokemon they win the most with, they will be able to know 
where their strengths and weaknesses lie. 

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project is of interest to me because I have recently been getting into the *VGC*
format of competitive Pokemon, and have not been able to find a match history tracking 
tool that would usually exist for other competitive games.
